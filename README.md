## Resources
- Javascript
- HTML
- VS Code
- Mapbox
- Leaflet
- CSS

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to display earthquake GeoJSON data (e.g. location and magnitude) using various map styles and overlays.

## Results
The finished map includes a filter in the top right corner that allows the user to select the map type (i.e. satellite, street, dark) and the layers of data to be displayed. These layers of data include:
- Where earthquakes have occurred
- Where major earthquakes have occurred
- Where the tectonic plates are located

In making our map customizable it allows the user greater accessibility in viewing the data per their needs.
